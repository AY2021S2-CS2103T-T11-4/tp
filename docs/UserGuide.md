## **1. Introduction**
Welcome to our User Guide and thank you for using CakeCollate! Are you a home baker searching for a reliable tool to keep track of your orders? 
While there may be other modern applications such as Microsoft Excel that may be able to help you keep track of your data, they may not be the most efficient or simplest
way for you to manage your data. 

CakeCollate promises to be an efficient desktop application that allows you to easily consolidate and manage your orders. Our main features include:<br>
1. Order management
2. Order Item management
3. Reminders for undelivered orders that have delivery dates approaching the current date
4. Checking the delivery status of your orders

It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you're a small-time cake seller that can type fast, CakeCollate can get your order management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **2.2 Reading the User Guide**
In this section, you will learn how to read CakeCollate's User Interface (UI), the format of commands, and the user inputs
commands may receive.

#### **2.2.1 Sections of the UI**
![User Interface](images/Annotated%20UI.png)

#### **2.2.2 Formatting of Commands**

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: How to interpret the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional fields that the user can choose to include or not as an input.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times. <br>  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc. <!-- order desc? --> 

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
  
* `INDEXES` refer to the list number of orders on the left of the GUI while `ORDER_ITEM_INDEXES` refers to the list number of order items on the right of the GUI <!-- [comment]: <> (can add a link to the gui screenshot and annotate which index refers to what) -->

* Items that are `INDEXES` or `ORDER_ITEM_INDEXES` take in whole number parameters separated by spaces. 
  For example, for a command that takes in `oi/ORDER_ITEM_INDEXES`, you can input `oi/1` or `oi/1 4 5`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **4. Features**

This section contains information about all existing commands and features that we have implemented.
Being well-versed in this section will enable you to use our application to it's fullest potential. 

### **4.1 Orders**

#### **4.1.1** ***Interacting with orders***

##### Adding an order: `add`

Adds an order to the CakeCollate database. The order will be initialised as undelivered, but can be modified with the `delivered` and `cancelled` commands found below.

###### Simple format

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS d/DELIVERY_DATE o/ORDER_DESCRIPTION... [t/TAG]...`

Examples:

* `add n/Betsy Crowe e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 d/13-05-2100 o/chocolate cake o/5 durian cake o/10 mochi cake 100 t/friend t/daughter` adds an order with all compulsory fields, three order descriptions, and a friend and daughter tag.

* `add n/Betsy Crowe e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 d/13-05-2100 o/chocolate cake` adds an order with all compulsory fields, one order description and no tags.


###### Alternative format 

Advanced Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS d/DELIVERY_DATE oi/ORDER_ITEM_INDEXES [o/ORDER_DESCRIPTION]... [t/TAG]...`

* The difference here compared to the previous format is that you can omit the `ORDER_DESCRIPTION` parameter is optional, but you need to include an `ORDER_ITEM_INDEXES` parameter.

* This alternative format is aimed at saving you some typing. If an order description you want to type already exists in the order items table of the GUI, you can specify its index instead of typing its entire name out.

* For example, for an order that involves chocolate cake, if `chocolate cake` exists in the order items table as shown in the screenshot below, instead of typing `o/chocolate cake`, you can type out `oi/1`

[comment]: <> ({screenshot})

Examples

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 d/13-05-2021 oi/1 4 5` adds an order with all compulsory fields and adds order items 1, 4, 5 of order items table to the order.

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 d/13-05-2021 o/strawberry cake oi/1` adds an order with all compulsory fields, an order description of strawberry cake and the first item in the list of order items in the GUI.

:information_source: **How are items added to the order items table?**<br>

When you specify an order description using the prefix `o/`, e.g. `o/chocolate cake`, the app automatically adds it into the order items table. As such, you don't need to go through extra steps to add in items into the order items table manually.

##### Adding a special request to an order: `request`

Adds a special request to an existing order in the CakeCollate database.

Format: `request INDEX r/REQUEST`

* Adds a special request to the order at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed order list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* Adding new special requests to an order will replace the existing special request the order currently has.
* You can remove an order’s special request by typing `r/` without specifying any requests after it, or only simply
specifying the index without adding the prefix.

Examples:
* `request 1 r/More sugar, spice and everything nice` Sets the special request of the 1st order to be `More sugar, spice and everything nice.`
* `request 1 r/` Removes the 1st order's current special request.
* `request 1` Removes the 1st order's current special request.
* Assuming the special request on an order was previously empty as shown in this picture,
![empty_request](images/Empty_request.PNG) using the command `request 1 r/More sugar, spice and everything nice` would
update the order's current special request to ![fllled_request](images/Filled_request.PNG) 
using the command `request 1` or `request 1 r/` on the same order again would update the request of the order back to 
![empty_request](images/Empty_request.PNG).


##### Deleting an order: `delete`

Deletes the specified orders from the CakeCollate database.

Format: `delete INDEXES`

* Deletes the orders with the specified `INDEXES`.
* The `INDEXES` refers to the order `INDEXES` number shown in the list of orders.
* One or more `INDEXES` can be entered.
* The `INDEXES` **must be valid**.

Examples:
* `delete 2` deletes the order with `INDEX` 2 from the CakeCollate database.
* `delete 2 3` deletes the orders with `INDEXES` 2 and 3 from the CakeCollate database.

###### Setting the delivery status of an order as cancelled: `cancelled`

Sets the delivery status of the specified order/orders from the CakeCollate database as `cancelled`.

Format: `cancelled INDEXES...`

* Sets the delivery status of the orders with the specified indexes as cancelled.
* The `INDEX` refers to the order `INDEX` number shown in the list of orders.
* One or more indexes can be entered.
* The `INDEX` **must be valid**.
